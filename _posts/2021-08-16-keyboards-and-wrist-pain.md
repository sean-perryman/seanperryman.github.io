title: Keyboards and Wrist Pain

While my wrists have been hurting for a while now, trying to write with a purpose has exacerbated the condition to the point where I have to take breaks from 
typing now. I've never had to take breaks before, I've always just blasted out whatever I'm typing with a reckless abandon. Now, I find myself having to stop 
to think about what to type next, and just taking a little bit longer before getting back into it. My WASD Code v2 (Greens) keyboard just isn't doing it for 
me anymore. [Mechanical Keyboards DOT Com](mechanicalkeyboards.com) suggests that high best switch for pure typing is something called a "BOX White", which I 
have never heard of before. Searching Amazon I found an MSI-branded keyabord that purports to have these switches, so I've ordered it. Hopefully it provides a 
much needed respite from the pain I have been feeling lately. 

Oh, I have two of these WASD Code V2 (green switches) keyboards if you want one. I used to buy two keyboards; one for the office and one for home. Now that 
home is the office it saves me a bunch of money.
