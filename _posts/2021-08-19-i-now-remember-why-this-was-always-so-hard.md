Trying to write something every day, no matter the length of content, is difficult. Hell, doing anything productive day after day is; even something as stupid 
and natural as brushing your teeth or working out. I've always found that a routine helps with this immensely, which is why I am trying to do this every day 
for as long as I can. I found that for almost 6 months I would work out (e.g. elliptical or rowing machine), then take a shower, brush my teeth, and get 
dressed and my day would just seem more fulfilling. There are certainly those days where I just lop around and don't even want to get dressed, those days seem 
like they go on forever and are just not fulfilling at all. 

I don't really know how long this "run" will last, but getting my thoughts down somewhere has been an enjoyable experience so far. Yesterday I tried messing 
around with the "theme" for this Jekyll blog, but was unable to get it working. I guess I will just stick with the default for now!
