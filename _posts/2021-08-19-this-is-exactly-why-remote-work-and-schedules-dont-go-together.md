title: This Is Exactly Why Remote Work And Schedules Don't Go Together

This morning started off pretty well. I snoozed once, got up and had some coffee. Then it all went down hill. While I was able to write my original daily 
post and eat breakfast, right after that I started getting hounded about issues and had to break off from my routing. It's now noon and I am two hours late 
for my scheduled "exercise and shower", and am still in just a shirt and shorts. Some days you eat the bear, some days the bear eats you. 

Havng young children doesn't help, as even when both parents are at 100% kids just need stuff from you. My son will often just want me to make him food, even 
though my wife is not busy with anything. If she does make it for him, he won't eat, so I end up having to make him the exact same thing in the same way and 
all is good.
