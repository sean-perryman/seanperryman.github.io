I was watching V for Vendetta for probably the one hundredth time, and for the one hundreth time I saw his knife belt and wanted one for myself. I don't know 
that I would ever really carry it as a usable piece, it's just cool. I don't know that I am interested in knives enough to be able to throw them with enough 
speed and accuracy to make it a viable carry weapon, I guess I'm just enamoured with his ability to dispatch his foes with a flick of his wrist. This got me 
on the subject of building your own kit again. 

I suppose this all started about 10 or 11 years ago when I was still playing WoW. A friend of mine had a rogue and wanted to do BGs with me, so I bought a 
leveled rogue and began plying him. I had really know idea how to play this character since I had never leveled a rogue myself, and it showed in how the games 
went. Not that it wasn't fun, mind you, just that if I had been playing a character I brought up from 0 to 60 I would have been much more proficient with 
spells and abilities. I think the same holds true for weapons that you carry, or even tools that you use for your daily work. 

There are thousands upon thousands of IT companies out there, and it's a good bet that they use different tools to get the job done. Not to say that a good 
many of them don't share specific tools in their set, but the exact make up differes from person to person; even within the same company. I would use one set 
of tools to remove malware, while my colleague might use a completely different set. They are both effective at getting the job done, but since we both 
cultivated our own toolsets we are more proficient with them than we would be with each others. 

There is something to be said about being built and not bought. Just because something is easy doesn't mean it is the right thing to do. Build your own kit 
and you will be a better everything for it.
