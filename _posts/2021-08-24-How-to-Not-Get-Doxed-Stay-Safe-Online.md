NOTE: _I am posting this here for posterity. I did not write it, but it is fantastic advice for anyone who doesn't strictly follow societal norms._

# Basic stuff you should already know
## Limit your personal information
No one needs to know your name, who you are, what you do or where you do it. If a site requires personal information simply lie, or make sure it's set to 
private. With current leaks I would suggest you simply make a fake persona, and go with it. Go with something like Hugh Mungus, born on 4/20/69 from Batman, 
Turkey. Or whatever else you see fit.

## Do not use the same name on multiple websites or apps
This is the most basic advice I can give you. It's common for people to use the same name on multiple websites, and it's very easy to go from website to 
website collecting bits and pieces of the information they leave on every site. Either be careful about what you post, or use different names for different 
sites. Specially if you use degenerate furry and fetish sites.

## Avoid social media
Social media is cancer, and you don't need it. Social media sites and apps store insane amount of information that can help people like me track you down. If 
you have to use Facebook or Instagram, always, always set it to private. Never use a nickname you use, or used. I'll talk more about this later.
* Most profile pictures from social media can be ripped, so don't take pictures that may help narrow down your location such as a window behind you.
* Always disable location.

## Change your passwords
No brainer, but people don't do it because we're lazy. Leaks happen, passwords get out. You can use several sites like haveibeenpwned to see which leak has 
your information. That information can easily be found, so change whatever was compromised.
So change your passwords, and don't be a cheeky cunt with a single Caps Lock change because that's the first thing people like me try.
Also, I would suggest you take an hour each month and go over your emails to see if anything leaked and requires your attention.

## Different email for every site
It's wise to not use the same email for multiple sites. Limit your email to a few sites, or if possible one email per site. This will make it much harder for 
people to get your information if something leaks. Since even if your email and password leak, it will only cause damage to one account which you can easily 
fix.

## Use a VPN
While you don't have to, it doesn't hurt if you do. A VPN will help you stay anonymous. While your connection might be slightly slower, you will be safer. 
However, don't use some exceptional bootleg knockoff VPN. I'll post some a few you can look into and maybe use.
Express VPN - 15 months (12 months, 3 free), 6.67$ monthly. Offers a 30 day money back guarantee.
Nord VPN - 12 months, 3.93$ monthly. Offers a 30 day money back guarantee.

## Two factor authentication
The chances of someone stealing your phone, cloning your SIM or hacking all your emails are slim. It will keep your accounts safer. I would suggest everyone 
uses this. Just be sure you always keep the security and safety of your backup method up to date.

## Don't download weird things from weird sources
One risky download can mess you up horribly. No matter which device you use and how safe you think you are.

## Don't go on random links
These days people will use websites to get your IP. They can use it to narrow down your location, hack you if they're hackerman or simply DDOS you. However if 
you use a VPN, you're good mate.

_(also how to stay safe)_

## Facebook
Facebook stores a metric fuckton of your personal and private information. If you're a boomer and insist on using it, do the following.

  *  Set your profile to private (Changed in Privacy Settings)
  *  Hide your friends list (Changed in Privacy Settings)
  *  Change your banner image to an image that will have zero likes (You can finesse the system and see much more if you're a cheeky cunt)
  *  Do not like any banner image
  *  Have none or as little possible likes (Shows, People, Games, ...)
  *  Make sure your Facebook URL doesn't use any nickname you used in the past or use currently

One of the worst things about Facebook is the forgotten password system. If you enter someone's email it will show you their full name and picture, and I 
believe you can guess what we can do with that information.
Really you don't need Facebook in this day and age. Facebook is cancer and it has too many traps that can get you doxed.

## Instagram
Instagram is really simple since all you need to do is change your profile to private. If you want to feel special you can do the following.

  *  Don't accept people you don't know
  *  Don't use a bio that is a self dox (No one cares about your life)
  *  Make sure your username isn't a nickname you use or have used before


## Twitter
If you use Twitter to shitpost you wont change it to private, so just follow these steps.

  *  Disable showing your email when you use forgotten password (Twitter will show something like DS*******@g****.*** which with the right tools, or time you 
can guess since they show the correct number of signs. So let's play DS(7*)@g(4*).(3*) > DSPisafag@gmail.com)
  *  Disable showing your number when you use forgotten password
  *  Do not use a nickname you use or have used before


## YouTube
If you use YouTube for personal, non detractor stuff follow these simple steps.

  *  Make sure your username isn't the same as a nickname you use or have used in the past
  *  Make sure your tag isn't a nickname you use or have used in the past
  *  Make sure you don't show your nickname in videos (Gameplay, Streaming, ...) if you have gameplay videos and decided to change your style be sure to nuke 
those videos to oblivion
  *  Make sure your channel URL doesn't include your name, current or old nickname


## LinkedIn
You are fucking exceptional to use this site and give it all the information it asks for. Why on earth would you give all of your private information up on a 
silver platter? If I find your LinkedIn, I will most likely know where to find you from 9 to 5. LinkedIn also had two leaks in the past that didn't help their 
case, at all.
If you have to use it, use common sense, I guess? I mean you are willingly doxing yourself when you use LinkedIn so I don't know what to tell you.

# Overall advice you should keep in mind

## Likes
Likes on social media can be public. On Facebook if you like someone's banner picture, it will be public. I often dox someone's friends first, and make my way 
through them to narrow it down and find my target. So this has often helped me.
Same goes for Instagram. If the person's account is set to private yet the profile of the person they like stuff from isn't set to private, you can find them. 
I've often looked over someone's friends or topics that I believe they liked to find them.

## Steam
Steam keeps your old nicknames. If you search for some old username you used, your Steam account will show up even if you currently use a new name. So I would 
suggest if you change your name, to spam change it so that old names are gone from the recent name list. I would personally suggest you change your account to 
private, because Steam offers lots of good information.

## Groups
Do not join autistic "private" detractor groups on Twitter. There is absolutely no need to be in a group where you shit talk other detractors and/or share 
stuff about your private life.
If you're in a group of people that shits on person X in private, but are polite to person X in public, I can guarantee you they do the same to you and you 
are person X in another chat. Most of these groups are also a gold mine of information since all of it leaks eventually, and it only makes you look like a 
twat. When it leaks you also make enemies with the people you badmouthed and they might want to use the information you shared to fuck with you.

## People you meet online
Never share your personal information with people you meet online. Once you tell someone something, you can't take it back. It's on the person to keep it or 
spread it and that's not something you can private or disable. The information you give is forever, your friendship might not be. Use common sense, know how 
much information is too much.

## Pictures you share
Pictures are a great tool when I'm doxing someone, so be careful what you share. Car registration plates, bars, clubs, restaurants, stores, signs, landmarks 
and so much more can help people like me narrow it down. God forbid you take pictures of your apartment, or pictures from inside your apartment where I can 
see out from a window. As with most things, common sense goes a long way.

## Google yourself
The best way to see what information is out there is to Google yourself. Check your nickname, or nicknames. Search using quotation marks for more accurate 
results.
e.g. "chemicals turning frogs gay"
