I am writing this on Monday morning because of course I am. I did manage to get out of bed and not fuck around 
on Saturday for a change. I went out and got some work done on the porch, but ended up spending a bunch of time 
trying to figure out angles for the roof trusses. This is more work than I had anticipated. I found later that I 
can buy these pre-made trusses, but they seem pretty expensive. I think that I can build them, though the lumber 
I need is about 2 hours away and it's really long so I'll have to strap it over the top of my truck to get it 
home. Oh, and my front-right tire has a bubble again so that is fun. I really need to just replace those tires, 
I just haven't been able to bring myself to do it yet. Probably going to have to work on that this week. 

Saturdays are always difficult it seems. On weekdays I have a set schedule of shit I either need to do, or 
should be doing, so it's much easier. Mostly I just need to be in front of my computer so if/when someone calls 
I can fix whatever their issue is so I can go back to doing nothing at all. It's funny how those things go; if I 
try and go work outside or whatever I will seemingly get tons of calls. If I literally sit in front of my 
computer and do nothing it is quite as a mouse. Go figured. 

I also really have a bunch of "computer work" that I really fucking need to do, but for one reason or another I 
just don't. There are projects that are literally languishing (e.g. moving public folders from old exchange to 
new exchange) that a clear process exists for, but that I just can't bring myself to do. I tell myself I am 
worried about data loss and shit, but thats not it. Maybe I'm just scared because as with most stuff the buck 
stops with me.
