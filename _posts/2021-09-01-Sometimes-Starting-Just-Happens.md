My post a few days ago was on the topic of not being able to start. This spoke about projects more specifically, 
and that I tend to have WAY more ambition than actual drive. This was certainly not the case last night!

I have a website that I have been kind of pooping around on for a while. I have the tab open in my browser 
always, and would look back at it every so often. Well, last night the muse was all over me so I cranked out a 
BUNCH of work on it that I had been kicking around in my head for a long time. It really felt good to make some 
progress, and I think that overall it is coming along nicely. I also decided that I'm not going to carry that 
theme forward into another web app associated with this project, at least not right now. The default looks 
pretty nice, and is definitely more functional than something I could make. I may, at some point, pay someone to 
do the conversion work, but that is for after this project starts generating some income.

I also signed up for the London Writer's Salon this morning (EST meeting). This is a zoom meeting that you can 
join and write for an hour with a bunch of other writers. As was suggested to me by a post on Medium I can not 
readily find, it's not that you interact with these other writers, just that writing at the same time as so many 
other people can be an uplifting experience. Who knows, maybe I can get some work done on that book that I also 
have open in a browser tab which has been staring me in the face for months no with no progress.
