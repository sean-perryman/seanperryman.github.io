Are inexorably connected. Since I've been doing this, I have found myself with more desire to read. I've been 
reading this book on marketing, and while I was getting tires put on my truck I brought a fiction book and read 
almost 100 pages during the time I was there. I don't recall a time in my life I was ever able to do that; just 
sit there and read and enjoy it. I have probably close to 100 books, on all different subjects, and most of them 
have never been read. I am hoping that by exercising my writing muscle, and by reading more and finding more joy 
in it, I can change that.
