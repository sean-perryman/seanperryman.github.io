There was a time in my life when I got an email from Steam and was very excited that something on my wishlist 
was on sale. Usually I would just buy it right away, along with whatever else on my wishlist was on sale, and 
even chcekc the box to install the items and make a desktop shortcut. Most of these items never got launched 
then, and are still sitting in my library today unplayed and seemingly unloved. Sure, there are a few sweetheart 
titles that I just love and could go back and play anytime (I'm looking at you, Gunpoint), but for the most part 
my Steam catalog is just a mess of shit that looked interesting at the time, but no longer holds that interest. 

Why do we do things like that? Just buy something knowning full well we will never use it? When I worked for 
Applus we would get into these kind of contests during Steam sales to see who could basically spend the most 
money. Buying stuff for ourselves, for eachother, whatever. We didn't really keep a count per se, but that 
little Steam newsfeed for your profile would show what you bought so it was usually fairly easy to tell who won. 

We do this in life too, for me it is often with tools. Sure, tools have a use they were designed for. Usually I 
would buy a tool I needed immediately, then into the box or the shed it would go never again to see the light of 
day. Occasionally you might find another use for that tool (e.g. use it as a hammer when it is the closest heavy 
thing), but typically they just sit there. Like games in my Steam library.
