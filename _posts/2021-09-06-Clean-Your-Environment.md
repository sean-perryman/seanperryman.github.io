Something I've been thinking a lot about recently is whether having a clean desk helps with gaiing a clear mind. 
My desk has been a disaster for months now, if not longer. It has alawys seemed that in the past if I was to 
completely clean off my desk I would just feel better about life, so I have been trying to work up to doing this 
again. Slowly I can remove stuff and put it away, but there is a lot of stuff that doesn't technically have a 
home. So it ends up in a box until I inevitably want it again, at which point it ends up on my desk. It's a 
vicious cycle. I think the only way I can escape it is to just throw stuff like that away. It's not even that 
big an ask, usually it is just stuff I don't really need and could do without. 

The point is things affect you more than you might realize. When you over eat or drink to much you will end up 
feeling like shit. When you are working out every day, even just walking, and eating better you will feel 
better. Same with the desk clutter. If your desk is clean and organized it seems to affect other aspects of your 
life as well. Try it. You might be surprised at the results.
