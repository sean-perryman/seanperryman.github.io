After building this porch roof I have a new respect for people who work outside for a living. On Saturday I 
built the trusses to support the roof. On Sunday I installed them. On Monday I got the sheating up there and put 
down the felt, now I have to install shingles to protection the whole thing from the elements. Up and down the 
ladder, carrying heavy stuff, it is really difficult work when you aren't used to it (and I am guessing probably 
when you ARE used to it as well). At the end of the day yesterday I was beat, couldn't keep my eyes open. Back 
hurting. But it felt good, like I accomplished something for a change instead of just spinning my wheels like 
usual. Not that I am going to go out and try and get work building porches or something, but I think if it came 
down to it I could. Probably need to learn to measure and plan better first, though.
