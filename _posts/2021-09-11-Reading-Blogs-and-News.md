Something I have found myself enjoying more and more lately is reading over some tech blogs and news sites in 
the morning. I don't think it will ever get to the point where I am doing it incessantly like some of the people 
that make youtube videos on the subject, although that might be something I would like to do subconciously. I 
think it is more of a desire to try and stay at least a little more current on what is happening, in the hopes 
that if somewhere I work for is attacked I'll have at least a cursory knowledge of what is going on. 

I have been pretty damn lucky in my career so far, suffering two ransomware infections and having safe backups 
for both of them, resulting in only a minimal downtime. I was upset that the first time it happened (during tax 
season) it took almost 6 hours to get all of the files restored and everyone back to work. My boss at the time 
told me  he had been upset as well, until he researched and saw that it was typically weeks before an 
organization was back online following an incident like that. So I guess I did OK afterall. 

That reminds me, I need to check backups everywhere. Don't let me be here talking about how I have my shit 
together just to get it pushed in because I didn't set up Veeam to notify me when a backup failed.
