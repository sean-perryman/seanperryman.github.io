title: Figuring Out a Script Error Can Be AMAZING

I say this because I've been tinkering around with a little stock ticker on the bottom corner of my computer 
screen. It's ticker.sh, which is a bash script that takes as many arguments in the form of ticker symbols, and 
returns the most pertinent info about the stocks price. I have a raspberry pi in my closet that is sitting 
there, so I found a $9 LCD screen for it and was going to make that be my ticker on my desktop. It's sat there 
for a day or two, and I decided today to get it working. 

With some trial and error, I was able to get a python script to call this bash script, parse the output, and 
format it for the VERY small screen (4x20). After 20-30 tries I got it to work, and it just made me feel like a 
rockstar. This is probably the most idiotic thing I've ever been excited about, and it literally has no effect 
on my life, but just the simple fact of getting a project done is fantastic. 

It's been a while since I've had that feeling. Definitely going to have to seek it out more! Just like with the 
website I was working on, shit maybe I'll start doing that more and maybe I will get good at it! 

Probably not, but it's a nice thought.
