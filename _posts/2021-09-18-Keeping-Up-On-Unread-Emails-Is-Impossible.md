title: Keeping Up On Unread Emails Is Impossible

I have A LOT of email addresses. I have addresses for business, personal, spam, you name it. Each of them is 
important in some way. My Steam account is tied to one. I get server alerts on another. User login alerts on 
another. What all of this boils down to is a lot of emails I have to quickly browse and mark as read each day, 
or everything goes to hell.

This is doubly hard on weekends where I am not planted in front of my computer for the whole day. I get back to 
my desk on Monday and the numbers have ticked up significantly, causing a weird sadness in my soul. Sure, I 
could just ctrl-a and mark them all as read, but is that really the answer? Cruising through them I see the 
usual alerts, but I also see a couple of requests that I would have otherwise missed. Glad I didn't try and 
shortcut it. 

The point I am making here is, when you get this embedded in a technology it is difficult at best to just drop 
it, or even really keep it under control. The same can be said for things like Twitter and Facebook, which 
literally have psychologists on staff to try and figure out ways to keep you on their platform and browsing 
content as long as possible. Breaking away from that stuff can and is hard, but if you really have the desire 
you can do it. 

Also, don't just fill your time with some other bullshit. There has to be something better to do with yourself 
than look at cat pictures and shit.
