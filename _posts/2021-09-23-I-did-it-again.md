I even thought about it, too. Several times, in fact. It seems that keeping up with something like this is 
harder than anticipated, even though most of what I write is just drivel anyway. 

The rooster my wife keeps talkikng to likes to crow outside of our bedroom window and wake my daughter up. I 
tried to shoot it with a nerf gun to scare it off, but the gun wouldn't fire like normal. I loaded another dart 
and pointed at the wall, shot just fine. Oh well. 

I'm going to go out and do some work on the chicken house as no one else seems to be making any progress either. 
Perhaps my action with spur on the others.
