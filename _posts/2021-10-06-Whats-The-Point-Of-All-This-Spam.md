title: Whats The Point Of All This Spam

I took over a very small web hosting business from a friend a couple of years ago, and it is mostly on 
auto-pilot. For the most part, none of the clients ever need anything. I monitor the email and the ticket 
system and keep up with licensing and updates, but basically it just sits there making a very small amount of 
money every month.

Oh, and I'm guessing because it is well established, I get tons and tons of spam tickets every day. What I don't 
get is that literally most of them have nothing actionable in them. No links, the reply address is bunk, no 
information to ingest. What the hell is the point of that? At that point, you are just spamming to spam I guess. 
You aren't even pretending to add any value to anything, you are just making noise. 

While I, and probably everyone else, hate spam, I can see the point in some cases. Promoting a product or a 
service or something would be a good use for spam, though I most likely wouldn't engage with anyone using that 
practice but that is another point altogether. 

Maybe I am just missing something here, but I really don't see the point of sending out an email full of random 
shit to an email address you aren't associated with.
