If you look at the repo for this *blog* you will see something called post.bat. This is what I do:

1. Type in *post "Post Title Goes Here Without Quotes"*
2. Write my post, sometimes changing the date in the *date:* field.
3. I have the script output the file name on screen so I can copy it and paste it to a move command so 
everything is good and proper.

Easy peesy, right? In my almost always hurry, in nano I just hit *CTRL+X* and then hit enter a few times to get 
back to the command prompt. I literally just realized right now that during the saving process, I can just 
fucking save the file as the appropriate name and not as the name that the post.bat file creates for me 
automatically based on the date of the posting. 

I really am dumb.
