I am pushing out an upgrade to a watchguard firebox I manage that is physically located across the country. 
These times are always stressful because if it shits the bed, I have to talk someone who is not entirely 
technical through getting it back online; assuming it will ever come back online. Usually these things go OK, 
but I have had issues in the past. I usually try and do things like this when I am onsite, but the last time I 
was there I just didn't have the time. Too much going on. 

Hold on to your butts!

EDIT: The update failed. Didn't brick it, but just pooped out. Something wrong with a switch maybe? I'm pinging 
the GW and it drops A LOT. Ugh.
