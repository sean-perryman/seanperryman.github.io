No matter how much I know that I shouldn't watch stupid ass youtube videos all day, I still do. It's almost like 
a drug addiction or something at this point. I go a few hours doing other shit, but then I pop in to see if 
anyone I like has posted anything. I don't even generally like what they are saying, so why the hell do I do it? 
Who knows.
