Ever since I figured out that a cPanel account can receive a git push from the command line, my life has not 
been the same. This is seriously the easiest way to work on a website. You just edit it like you normally would, 
then you make a git command and push it. A few seconds later the change is reflected on the site, bingo bango! 
At some point I may put together a tutorial or something for this because it is seriously fantastic. This blog 
uses something similar, though it is hosted on GitHub Pages or whatever. Same principal though, I make an 
update, a commit, then I push it and we're done! EASY PEESY!
