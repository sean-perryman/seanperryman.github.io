I go through fits and spurts like everyone. I have been listening a lot to old video game sound tracks (FF7, 
CHrono Trigger) and it makes me want to play them again. I do have an NES Classic and an SNES Classic which I 
could easily hook up to my elgato cam thingy that takes an HDMI in, I just haven't done that yet. I guess I 
should probably do that and play some games before I make a decision like this, especially since the Playstation 
Classic has not gotten stellar reviews. In fact, people specifically say that FF7 runs like shit on it. Maybe 
I'll just trying and find an actual PS1 and the game itself. Who knows.
