I've thought several times about doing this blog as a podcast or a YouTube channel thing, but I think that the 
only way I could do it is if I could be more consistent about writing these. Sometimes I go two or three days 
without making a post, then write a few in one day and back date them so the timeline is in tact. I don't think 
this would work as well in that context, but I may be wrong. 

When I tried it before there was always the emphasis on making "10 minute long videos" and nothing less, but I 
have since learned that is not strictly true; plenty of shows have succeeded with shorter videos. I guess in the 
end it really all depends on consistency and content. Even consistency sometimmes gets pushed aside, because 
again there are plent of channels that only upload every month or something and they are exploding in 
popularity. They must be hitting their niche exactly.
