title: Watching Someone Play Games Is Fun Afterall

I've been watching this guy on YouTube, U Can Beat Video Games, play though old NES games. It is surprisingly 
fun, moreso even than playing the games themselves. It helps that he seems to be pretty good at games, beating 
games I've played before and never got past the first part (Fester's Quest). I'm currently watching him play 
through the first Legend of Zelda and it's fantastic. Brings back a lot of memories of a game that I actually 
have beaten. It does kind of make me want to play it, though I don't know how seriously. I could definitely bust 
out the NES classic, but meh. Easier to just watch someone else do it I guess. 

I now see the appeal that the kids have for watching other people play video games instead of playing the game 
themselves.
