One of those days where you are stressed, but can actually finish a project or two so you feel like you are on 
top of the world. The engineer from the DC I use wrote me back asking what equipment I use, so I'm hoping he is 
trying to work out a solution where I will be able to add additional IP ranges when needed. That is basically a 
deal breaker, as i really don't have the capital to invest in more equipment and definitely not the capital to 
buy IP space. There are some places that will lease it to you, but that tends to be fairly pricey and I don't 
have the money to drop on another monthly bill, especially with nothing coming in from it. The minimum from VZ 
is enough already, plus the additional I pay to the DC for the full rack I am not even utilizing. Ugh. I know, I 
know. I signed the fucking papers. I pay the notes. Just don't have anything more to output at this point.
