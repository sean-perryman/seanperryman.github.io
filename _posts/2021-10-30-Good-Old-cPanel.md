I'm trying this server move again today, and am again running into a problem with one of the accounts. Not to 
mention the extreme amount of time this is taking. I know it is a good bit of data (@50GB or something), but 
this is to another VM on the same hypervisor. It is going from a spinny to an SSD10 raid, but it really 
shouldn't be that much difference. This is like ridiculously slow. Really need to not do this again lol

I did get through the one account that was scrolling past the red errors that make no sense and that the 
Internet think is a firewall issue, even though this is a local cpmove file. At least there is that I guess. The 
other account is currently filling up the logs with that shit, no idea what it means or why it is doing it.
