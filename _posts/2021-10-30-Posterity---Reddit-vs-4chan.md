I came across this 4chan post again and wanted to add it here for future reference. A very insightly look at the 
way these two sites operate, as evidenced by their user base. 

> You see, the problem with Reddit is that it works on the basis of encouragement rather than on the basis of 
hostility (as is the case with 4chan). 
> When you feel welcomed, your mindset changes and that's why all cults first try to make the person feel good 
and wanted before radicalizing them. 
> Reddit will only stop being a disgusting and pitiful place when the people there understand that calling 
others faggot and retard is essential to maintaining the mental health of their members.
