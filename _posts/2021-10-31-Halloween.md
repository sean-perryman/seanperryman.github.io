Halloween is definitely not as fun as it was when I was a kid. We took the kids around at the church for their 
trunk or treat. Maybe it is the lack of different candy this year (I looked, basically only chocolate was 
available), or maybe everyone is just beaten down from all of this bullshit. Who knows. It's just not the same, 
and it is sad for my kids. They may never know the pleasures of running around to all your neighbors and getting 
a big ass bag of candy that you try and eat that very night.
