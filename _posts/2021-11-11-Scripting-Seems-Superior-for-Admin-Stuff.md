title: Scripting Seems Superior for Admin Stuff

I had always been of the mindset that when I need a custom program that does some weird task, that I would need 
to fire up Visual Studio and put together a little C# program. I have learned over the past few months that this 
is not the case, and that using powershell or even batch works WYA better and much must faster. It also allows 
for way easier itteration, as I can "develop" right on the server that is affected. I've been slowly replacing 
the old C# programs I have written with powershell scripts and it is much much easier. Plus, it has the added 
bonus of being human-readable, meaning anyone who comes along after me should be able to discern what is going 
on with the script just by reading it. I don't have to provide anyone any source code, and then don't have ot 
install Visual Studio. Easy peesy!
