The prosecutor is a huge piece of shit. I think that probably all of them are, but it is so rare that we get the 
ability (or desire, really) to see it in this detail. He is just out there manipulating evidence to fit the lies 
that he is telling thje jury. Really dishearting as they are supposed to be after justice, not a win. I guess 
that old joke about cops needing to meet a quota might be true after all.

Everyone needs to pray for a good outcome. If the rioters are going to do it, they will do so whether or not 
Kyle is freed. Let's make the right decision people, please. This is a little boy here who has his whole life 
ahead of him.
