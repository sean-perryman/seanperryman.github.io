Why the hell can't I just do it? I heard back from my advisor and he gave me the green light, and the librarian 
pointed me in the right direction. I dunno, for some reason I am scared I think. Scared that it is going to come 
back and have a shitload of corrections or something. I dunno. I've been told I am fairly good at writing 
before, so maybe I really am. I know that, for sure, I use too damn many commas. I think I am writing how I 
would say it rather than how it should be written. I know that, for me, most times, I should just leave the 
commas out altogether. But this doesn't really matter.

I just need to do it. Just fucking do it already!
