AND IT'S NOT THAT BAD! Most of the stuff is just formatting and basic shit. Really a weight off of my shoulders. 
Now, I need to actually make those changes and get this shit out the door. That is going to be the hard part, 
because I am so completely over it at this point it's really hard to get motivated to do that. At least the 
librarian provided specific things I need to fix rather than just "your references are wrong" like I expected. I 
think her profusely for that. 

Maybe I can get this shit done next week or something, who knows. I did just pay off the last payment to them so 
this is literally the only thing standing in the way of the final conferment or whatever.

LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO
