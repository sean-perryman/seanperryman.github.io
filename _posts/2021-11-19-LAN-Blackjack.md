I worked for a Managed Service Provider at a time where everyone really was on top of their game. No one was 
necessarily busy, we all just had work that we had to do and that was it. We talked quite a bit, and something I 
often thought about was making a LAN version of Blackjack that we could play in the office. I'm sure there is 
something like that already, but it would just be a simple window where you would have your cards or whatever 
and could see the turned of cards of the other players. A little chat window would be nice, and a hot-key to 
minimize the whole thing. 

Even though it was a fairly simple idea I never got around to doing anything with it. I find that a lot in my 
life, interesting or even downright good ideas that I don't act on. 

I need to do something about that.
