It might not seem like a lot, but going an average of 60 MPH it will take 60+ hours to make the drive back and 
forth from California. That is a lot of audio book listening and thinking about the current state of things. 

I'll be doing this alone this time, with a little air mattress in the back seat of my truck to sleep. Luckily 
I've made the trip on the 40 enough times I recognize a bunch of the stops, so that is nice. I'll get to visit 
many of those cool rest stops and stores and stuff you can only find in the middle of fuck-all.
