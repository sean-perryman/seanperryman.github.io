Recently I was browsing through some Docker repos and saw something called Minetest-Server. Curious, I searched 
for Minetest and found a free, open-source clone of Minecraft complete with multiplayer and all that fun stuff. 
I downloaded and played it for a bit, it is not bad at all. It's a lot like a much younger Minecraft. The 
graphics aren't amazing, the physics aren't amazing, but overall the bones are there and it's not a bad entry. I 
think they probably should have titled it something different and maybe changed some mechanics to make their own 
game instead of a clone, but whatever. To each their own. 

You can check it out [here](https://www.minetest.net/).
