So I made it through all the episodes I missed, and they were pretty good overall. Some hit and miss, but I 
think I am better for the experience as a whole. Now I want more, might start going back through the old 
seasons. Things seemed better then, more hopeful, even for someone who seemingly has no hope like Bob.
