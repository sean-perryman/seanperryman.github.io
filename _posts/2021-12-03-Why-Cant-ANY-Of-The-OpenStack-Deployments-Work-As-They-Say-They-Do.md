title: Why Can't ANY Of The OpenStack Deployments Work As They Say They Do?

I mean literally none of them are functional. It's almost like they don't want anyone new to learn how to use 
the system for fear of losing their job security or something. Even the "OpenStack on Rails" Microstack from 
Canonical doesn't work. I mean what the fuck? It is literally two commands, from their own website, and it is 
not functional. Sure, you can launch a CirrOS instance from the command line and ping it from the host, and you 
can even ssh to it from the host, but that is where it stops. There is no route outside, and deploying any 
other OpenStack image (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, etc.) is not even that functional; even with using their special 
command "microstack launch <image> --name <name>". 

It is really disheartening. I am starting to wonder if this is like how when a woman (or a man) shys away from 
you when you are courting them it makes you want them more. Maybe that's what they are doing here by providing 
literal shit documentation and no active forums or methods of getting help other than the obligatory "RTFM NOOB"
