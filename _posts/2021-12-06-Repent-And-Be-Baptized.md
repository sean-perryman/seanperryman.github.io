At men's group last night we were reading through Acts Chapter 8 and were talking about the holy spirit. Some 
said that the holy spirit and the gift of the Holy Spirit are two different things, but I am not sure that they 
are. In Acts Chapter 2 verse 38

> Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of 
your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 

According to this text, simply going under the water in the name of Jesus means you receive the gift of the Holy 
Spirit. Why then, do some preachers joke about having to dunk certain people two or three times? Why then do I 
not feel like I have the Holy Spirit (or the gifts of such) after having been baptized? 

Personally, I feel that the Holy Spirit has two forms; the gift that you get initially, and the form of when 
that gift is actually opened and poured out upon you. I liken it to a Christmas present that you receive, but do 
not open until you are ready. I know that the Holy Spirit is present, but I don't feel like it pours out of me 
like perhaps it should. Others have told me they see it within me and how I conduct myself, so perhaps I am just 
too short-sided to see it. 

Who knows.
