I might have posted this before, but when I am doing any kind of programming I tend to take victory laps. I 
often get stuck on these seemingly small tasks, and when I accomplish something I like to stop and walk around 
the house. This is much easier when you work from home!

It gives me a time to reflect on a success and to see what else is going on. It also works to get me out of the 
programming zone and effectively kill any momentum I may have had. 

This is probably a bad habit to have.
