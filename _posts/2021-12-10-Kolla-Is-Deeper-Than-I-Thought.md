I've been playing more and more with Kolla, and even though I have experienced some failures, this system goes 
much deeper than just the quickstart I am working from. You can really customize it deeply (even with a 
VPN-as-a-Service component which is super interesting). I'm glad that I took the time to look into it further 
because when I first did, the whole thing seemed incredibly overwhelming.
