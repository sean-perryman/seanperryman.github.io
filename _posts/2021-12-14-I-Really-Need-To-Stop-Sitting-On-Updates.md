title: I Really Need To Stop Sitting On Updates

I tend to get really far behind in doing this whole "daily blog" thing. If it is just a couple of days I like to 
do all the posts and them post them en masse, but at this point I have like two weeks worth of unposted entries 
that are doing nothing for anyone. I'm thinking about setting up a script to run my upload batch file daily or 
something, that way I don't even have to post. Just write my entry and save it and let the system do the rest. 
Who knows, maybe it will just pile into the back of my brain like so many other things I want to do.
