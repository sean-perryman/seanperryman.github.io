I feel like Micraft versions are like Doctor Who in that whatever version you "started" with is the one you 
always go back to. Even though I started playing Minecraft during the alpha and continued on through what I now 
know to be about 1.10, I never paid attention to versions and such until 1.13 came out. The aquatic update was,  
in my opinion, the best Minecraft update ever released and is the one that I identify as my home version. I had 
been trying to do my solo hardcore runs on the newest version, but 1.18 has completed changed shit and it is 
super annoying. I don't believe I will do much 1.18 playing, as they expanded the world and completely changed 
where ores generate and stuff. I did a run through it and you just get down to the negatives and the caves are 
huge and hard to navigate. Just doesn't seem worth it anymore.
