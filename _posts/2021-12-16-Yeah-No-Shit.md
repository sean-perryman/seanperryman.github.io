[Pitfalls of Free WordPress Hosting To Beware 
Of](https://www.hostreview.com/blog/211216-pitfalls-of-free-wordpress-hosting-to-beware-of)

This is not necessarily a poorly written article or anything, it's just not at all the "gotcha" that I feel like 
they were going for. Of course there is no support, shitty performance, shit or no backups, etc. You aren't 
going to get the red carpet when you aren't paying for shit, and even though they are displaying "ads" on your 
site, you likely aren't getting any traffic anyway so they aren't making anything from that. If your site had 
traffic you would pay for hosting, simple as that. 

What is kind of funny is that after I have read this a few times, it looks like it is more of some kind of 
bootleg SEO article or something. They mention a very-specific UAE-based WordPress hosting site as a paid 
option, an no others. 

In whichever case want to take it, free WordPress hosting is not meant to be taken as a permanent solution for 
your high-traffic website. Save yourself the trouble and just get some paid hosting.
