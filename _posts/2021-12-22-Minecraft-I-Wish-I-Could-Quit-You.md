I keep flip-flopping on Minecraft, usually every time I die in a hardcore world. It's weird because it can be 
such a deep hurt making a stupid mistake like not watching my back and a creeper comes up on me, but at the same 
time I can just start a new world without thinking about it. I always kind of wondered about those supercut 
videos of people dying in their hardcore worlds and losing it, but I understand that much better now. 

I sort of wish I could just remove the game and not reinstall it, but it is so relaxing (for the most part) so 
it always draws me back in.
