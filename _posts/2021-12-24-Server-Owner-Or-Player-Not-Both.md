I think at at some point in any multiplaying-minecrafters "career" they think to themselves that the server 
owner is doing everything wrong and that they can do it better.

This is a mistake to think like this. It just never works out. 

Either you are the owner of the server and you spend your time fixing things, or you are the owner of the server 
and you spend your time watching what everyone else is doing. Sure, you could plan in vanish or something, but 
what is the fun in that? There is always the potential to own the server and not identify yourself as the owner, 
but that would kind of be hard to fake when you are basically the only person ever on the server when it is 
first starting out. 

You might be able to get by with saying you just found the server or whatever, but I dunno how well that would 
work.

If you want to own a Minecraft server, by all means, do it. Just don't go into it thinking that you are finally 
going to build the server that YOU want to play on. Because you won't.
