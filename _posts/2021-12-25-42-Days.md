Is my personal record for Minecraft Hardcore lasting. I am not really good at the game, and definitely need to 
step up my "mining and not paying attention", Almost all of the deaths have been by a creeper. 

What I probably need to do is try and rush and enchanting table and diamond armor, so I can actually survive 
those creeper blasts. Shit, even with full iron armor a skeleton can take you out with just 5 or 6 hits.
