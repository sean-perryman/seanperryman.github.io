I feel like I always view the end of the year as a time of reflection on the shit that I wish I had done 
throughout the year. Every year I try and use this time as a springboard to catapult me into the next year full 
of piss and vinegar, and with a determination to get more done. It doesn't always work, but sometimes it does. 
Who knows, maybe this will be MY year!
