I really intended to pound out my missing blog entries before the 31st, but I just didn't. No real reason why or 
anything, just lazy I guess. I haven't been keeping a terminal window open and ready, so that could certainly be 
part of it. 

Anyway, over the next few days I will get these all done and publishes so I can start off 2022 with some 
semblance of consistency (having finished off the last 3 months with a blog entry for every day of the month).

Let's do this!
