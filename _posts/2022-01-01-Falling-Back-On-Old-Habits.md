I find myself often trying the same thing over and over again, even though I know that it doesn't work. THis has 
been the case with my experimenting with OpenStack, with trying to beat Minecraft on Hardcore mode, and several 
other things in my life.

This year, I hope to break that cycle and try more and more new things instead. There is one OpenStack 
deployment I haven't tried yet (Triple O), and there is still the possibility of just following the docs and 
installing OpenStack manually. That is not off the table. 

For Minecraft, I have decided to dial it back some and just try and beat the game in Java in regular mode. I 
have beated the game on Bedrock edition previously, but never in Java. I feel like maybe I should do that before 
I try and beat it in Hardcore mode. 

Here is to a new year with new challenges, and new opportunities to sink or swim.
