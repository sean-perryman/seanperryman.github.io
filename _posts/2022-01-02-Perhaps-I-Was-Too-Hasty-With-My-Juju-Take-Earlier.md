I am sometimes willing to admit when I was wrong. At the end of another failed Charmed-OpenStack install I 
decided to just play around with it and see what I could come up with. It turns out that containerizing all of 
the parts of OpenStack is actually really helpful, and if you have significant knowledge of the inner-workings 
of OpenStack and how everything plays together this is a nice way of doing it. 

I, however, am not as savvy as I would like to be so it ends up being more frustrating than anything. I guess 
that it really all comes down to the fact that OpenStack is a complicated system and it really takes dedication 
to master it, or even to be able to use it functionally for anything other that just testing or playing around.
