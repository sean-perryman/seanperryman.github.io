The server rack I have in my closet apparently wasn't created with having wheels in mind. I noticed a week or 
two ago that the tabs that are meant ot bolt ito the floor, that I instead bolted wheels two, were buckling and 
thats why I had trouble rolling the rack around. 

The solution? 

2 "rails" made of 2x6 and a new set of heavier-duty casters.

The result? 

A much taller rack (+6"), but significantly easy to move around. I did, however, install one of the switches and 
one of the servers upside down. The switch isn't such a big deal, but the server is currently being used as a 
platform for a bunch of other servers, so it is not an easy task to flip it around. 

Oh well, there is always next weekend I guess!
