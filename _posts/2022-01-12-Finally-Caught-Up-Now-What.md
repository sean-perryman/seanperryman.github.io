title: Finally Caught - Up Now What?

I feel like I've spent so long catching up on old posts (to maintain the 'ol one post per day), that I don't 
know what to do with myself know that I am caught up. Of course this is rhetorical, I need to continue making 
posts and try and actually maintain the one post per day momentum. Still, it feels weird to have so many posts 
done, with many of them coming in the last few days. 

One of the big takeaways is to make sure to just "post" the post as soon as it's done. Don't stop and try and 
batch it out, that just ends up clumping them up (or even forgetting about them until WAY later). If I can just 
post when the post is done I'll be posted and the post will post the post. 

Other than than, I submitted the final revision of my dissertation to ProQuest a few days ago so that was cool. 
I got the confirmation, so in 8-12 weeks I'll be a published academic and will have my hard copy of my 
dissertation that I can stick on my shelf to gather dust. I am curious to see what it will look like because it 
was fairly expensive to get a hardcopy, at least by book standards.
