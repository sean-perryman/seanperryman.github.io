I did a YouTube channel (actually a couple of them) right before all this bullshit happened, and I made the 
cardinal mistake of YouTube: I bought views and subs. I thought that maybe in doing that I would jumpstart 
something, I was definitely wrong. This time, I am just making the videos and not watching them or anything on 
my own channel, so that any views and stuff will be 100% organic. After 6 videos and 9 days, I got my first 
view.

It feels good; a lot better than buying subs and views. Whether or not the channel succeeds is irrelevant, I am 
just trying to have some fun talking about stuff that I like.
