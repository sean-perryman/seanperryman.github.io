I am making the drive from Kentucky to Dallas to pay a visit to the datacenter where my stuff is colocated. I 
need to install a router so I can take over routing duties from the ISP and so I can have more control over the 
networking aspect. I have the router (and the backup) configured and hopefully all goes well!

I also have my truck over-stocked with supplies (tools and such) just in case, so hopefully I won't need any of 
it!
