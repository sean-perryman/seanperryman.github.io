The name of the game in doing anything like this (blogging, youtube, reading the bible) is consistency. For 
example, letting it lag just one day is not a huge deal, but it is a gateway to it no longer mattering to you. 
With my little youtube venture for example, I am already far enough behind the "72 videos in 90 days" schedule 
that if I do 1 video every single day until the end of the 90 days I will still be 9 videos short. Now, I am not 
letting this discourage me because all it really means is that I need to have 9 days where I do 2 videos or 
something like that.

But it's the same with the blog posting. I am writing this on the 19th, when I should be writing an entry for 
the 19th on the 19th. I am hoping that if I can keep these activities even moderately tight I will get to the 
point where I can consistently do these every day and make it into a real and formed habit.

Here's to hoping!
