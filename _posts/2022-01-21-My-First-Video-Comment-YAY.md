Someone left a nice comment on my OpenStack is Hard video asking about another system, oVirt. This is something 
that I have only had brief interactions with previously. I attempted to install it using their ISO and that did 
not work at all so I moved on. 

I gave the website a look-over and it seems that it can be installed on a new CentOS 8 Stream install, so I 
might give that a shot this weekend. The ground is covered in snow and all the outside work I want to do 
involves digging, so that is a no-go!
