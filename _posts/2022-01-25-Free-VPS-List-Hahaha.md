title: Free VPS List? Hahaha

I have a subscription to a system called VidIQ which provides some metrics and analysis tools for YouTube. They 
have a feature called "Daily Ideas", and one of the ones I got today was a hint on doing a video on Free VPS'. I 
thought that maybe this is now a thing (it isn't), so I looked up the first list of the best free VPS. Turns out 
the list is mostly made up of services which give you a free trial, or are otherwise so restrictive as to not be 
useful at all. The list did provide some interesting insight though in that one of the major factors of them 
potentially not trusting a site is that the About page and the address posted were either blank or fake. That 
isn't something I had considered before, but makes perfect sense. I don't personally care about an about page at 
a provider, but maybe those "market mavens" who are the tastemakers of the Internet do.
