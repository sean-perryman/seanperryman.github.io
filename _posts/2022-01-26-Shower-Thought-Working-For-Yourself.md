This was literally a shower thought I had. I often fantasize about what it would be like to work for someone or for some company. When I 
was young it was Cisco for example. This is, I think, the wrong way to go about life. You should be fantasizing about working for yourself; 
being your own boss and running your own company. That sounds like a much better life than constantly working for someone, hoping for that 
next raise or bonus or whatever. Control your own destiny.
