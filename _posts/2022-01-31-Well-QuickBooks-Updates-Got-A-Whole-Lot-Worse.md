title: Well QuickBooks Updates Got A Whole Lot Worse

I noticed this yesterday when I was trying to update QB on one of the RDS servers. It will quickly flash that it is doing an 
update when you launch the program, then when you go manually check it says there is still an update. So you close and reopen 
and the cycle repeasts itself. Seemingly infinitely.

There is the ability to download just the specific QB update file from the website, but that is a humungous pain in the ass. 
How can they make an already shitty program worse? Usually things tend to get better, but I guess in this case you cannot 
underestimate Intuit's ability to fuck things up.
