title: Typing Is Falling Behind Again

It's been a couple of days since I have practiced typing on my new keyboard. I feel like maybe 2-3 more hours of 
practice and I'll be able to just leave it plugged in, I just can't bring myself to do it for whatever reason. I 
am getting better for sure, up to like 15 WPM now which is relatively reasonable. It's just that when I get 
flustered I have to look down at the keys and I start stumbling and stuff. Just need to power through it like 
everyone says. Once I get good with this I definitely want to get the Dactyl Manuform and roll that, such a cool 
looking keyboard. Maybe once day in the future after I am a real ten-finger typist I can switch over to another 
key layout and not have it completely ruin my computing experience.
