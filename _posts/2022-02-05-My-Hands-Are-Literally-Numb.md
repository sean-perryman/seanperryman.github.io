I've really felt moved this morning to get through my backlog of missing blog posts, I think I'm 10+ into it at this point. 
Certainly not churning out hot fire, but at least it is something!

However, my hands are numb. Like, the bad kind of numb. RSI kind of numb. I probably need to chuck up that Kinesis keyboard and 
give it a twirl, this cannot be good.
