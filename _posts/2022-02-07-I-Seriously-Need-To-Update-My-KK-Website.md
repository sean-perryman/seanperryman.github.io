title: I Seriously Need To Update My KK Website

When I started my little YouTube channel I made a website to go along with it. I had wanted to try out Hugo, so that's what I 
did. Turns out, maintaining multiple blog-type websites is more work than I want to do. 

I should invest a bit of time in automating some cross-posting between YT and there. I can't imagine it would be that hard, 
just have to post the link, a large-version of the thumbnail, and scrape the description for the post text. 

Not a bad idea!
