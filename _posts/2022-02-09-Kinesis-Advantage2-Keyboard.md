My wrists and hands have been hurting lately, and I can't help but think it has something to do with my keyboard. I certainly 
don't have the stamina for typing I once did, and often find myself having to stop and rub my hands.

I first saw the Kinesis Advantage(2?) keyboard in Indie Game: The Movie when Jonathan Blow was using it. I thought it looked 
neat and I looked it up the, $300+. No thanks.

Fast forward and I'm looking at it again. It's now $350. I got lucky and found one ending soon on eBay with a pretty reasonable 
current bid, so I sat there and ended up getting it for $228. 

Now it's sitting on the couch behind my desk staring at me daring me to use it. 

I don't know if I'm ready yet, it is so different and such a departure from what I'm used to. I know that I just need to yolo 
and do it, but I kind of like being able to touch-type on my old-fashioned traditional keyboard. Maybe I'll just buy another 
regular keyboard with softer keys or something. 

I like buying stuff.
