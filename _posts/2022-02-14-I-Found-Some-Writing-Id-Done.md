title: I Found Some Writing I'd Done

I was cleaning and arranging my desk and I found a few pages of writing that I had done for the book I am/was working on, and it 
got me to thinking. I wonder if the act of my typing those pages into the writing program I am using will spark the interest 
again and get it going? It's about 10k words at this point, not a bad effort, but still pretty far off. I started it I think at 
the beginning of 2021, would be really nice to finish it!
