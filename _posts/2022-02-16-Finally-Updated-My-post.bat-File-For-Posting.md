title: Finally Updated My post.bat File For Posting 
date: '2022-02-16  6:47:07.43 -0400'

I am backdating this, but as of the current date I have updated my post.bat file so that when I do a post like there where I 
save as an older date, it gives me the option of deleting the file that gets created by default. 

The script echoes into a text file the formatting stuff for Jekyll, then runs nano for that file. By default, in Nano I save 
the file as a different date so the correct file exists with my writing and a basically blank file gets created too. Kind of 
annoying to CTRL-M, mark the file, the delete it. This will hopefully save me a little time, but ultimately I would like to not 
have to use it. If I could somehow get into the groove of posting daily this wouldn't be necessary, but that doesn't really 
feel like it's in the cards for me.
