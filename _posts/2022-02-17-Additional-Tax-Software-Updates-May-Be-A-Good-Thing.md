I am always looking for motivation in things that may not exactly be fun or exciting. Since Wolters Kluwer announced they are 
now updating ProSystem fx Tax mid-week as well as Saturday night (and now apparently Friday night as well), I have found myself 
just a little more jazzed for updates. It's not that security is not important, in fact it is probably more important now than 
ever before, it's just that it can be tedious and boring. I know that I need to be updating my servers often, and since I now 
haw to apply these updates multiple times a week it gives me more impetus to do just that. 

In a way, adding a bit more work to my plate may contribute to the whole thing being a little better off.
