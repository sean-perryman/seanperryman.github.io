It seems the days are going by faster and faster lately. I get up sometime in the 5AM hour, I have coffee and start doing my 
thing. I eat around noon or so, then by the time I know it 6PM rolls around and it's almost the end of the day. Where does the 
time go? I have so many things I should, and sometimes even want to, be doing, but I don't seem to get to them.

Hopefully acknowledging them is enough!
