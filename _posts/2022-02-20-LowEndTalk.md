I started kind of lurking around [LowEndTalk](https://lowendtalk.com) again, and it seems that not much has changed. Still the 
same "providers" there that are talking about whatever is semi-relevant to web hosting, and random users complaining about 
outages. I should probably pop over to [WHT](https://webhostingtalk.com) too and see what is going on there. Who knows what new 
developments have occurred in the web hosting industry (lol).
