title: QuickBooks Desktop Update Loop

Often I find that when I click on QB desktop on a XenApp server it tells me there is an update available, or that is doing an update. The program runs, then if I close and re-open I get the same message. Really a weird situation as running update 
from inside the program yields basically the same thing, keeping me in the update loop.

Figured out this morning that if you right-click and run as administrator, it ACTUALLY applies the update and fucks off. Good to know!
