YouTube is a really weird thing to try and get into. Like, I have TONS of ideas for cool videos, and many of them I have a plan for how I 
would do them, but I just don't. I think it is kind of like this blog here. At the start I was really into doing it every day, but now I am 
skipping it for weeks on end for no reason and then going back to fill in. 

I need to figure out some solid way to make a schedule and stick to it. Writing stuff around the bezel of my monitor works pretty good for 
many things, maybe I should try that.

In other news, I WAY crushed my YouTube goal of 200 views in February; already crested 500. Might not sound like a lot, but it is immensely 
satisfying doing it myself rather than paying for views and subs.
