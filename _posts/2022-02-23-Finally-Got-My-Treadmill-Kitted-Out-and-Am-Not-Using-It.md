title: Finally Got My Treadmill Kitted Out and Am Not Using It

I got the cover off, the dryer-vent fan in place, the temperature monitor, and now I have heatsinks on the motor; and I haven't used it in 
a few weeks. Mostly, I have been lazy this past week or two and have been sitting down all day at the computer rather than standing up. 
I've forgotten how easy it was to stand all day when you are doing the treadmill every hour or so. 

Lately I've just been going back to the back-room and using the elliptical for 30 minutes or so. While this seems like better exercise on 
the surface, it might actually have a net-negative impact on health as now I am just saying fuck it and sitting down all day. 

Probably have to find a balance in there. Would be really nice to treadmill all day AND do the elliptical at some point. Maybe I'll try 
that next week.
