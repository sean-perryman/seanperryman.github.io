And I had already typed it into the writing system I am using. So much for a quick jumpstart on getting back into it!

I did spend some time thinking about how I want the story to progress, I should probably write it down somewhere so I don't forget. Isn't 
that the story with life? You have these cool or interesting ideas that you never write down, so you never act on them. Gotta get out of 
that habit, this blog-thing was supposed to be that. Like I've said before, never too late!
