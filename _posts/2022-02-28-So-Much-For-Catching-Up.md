I had this grand plan of knocking out a bunch of these posts at once, and it just didn't turn out. It's just one of those 
things I guess, you just have to do it. Quit sitting there thinking about shit and just get it done.

This is my problem with almost everything in my life. I just have to get off my ass and do it. Doesn't help I have been sitting 
down a lot lately, that seems to lead to more inability or unwillingness to do anything.

Get it done.
