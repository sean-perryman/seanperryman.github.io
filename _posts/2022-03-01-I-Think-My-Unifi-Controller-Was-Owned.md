I can log into the server, but can't get to the web UI and trying to run the upgrade script fails and it can't login to take a 
backup.

This is my fault for sure, I certainly don't update this as much as needed. Luckily, I have a backup from December that should 
have everything relavent in it so I'm not really losing anything. Just a pain in the ass is all.
