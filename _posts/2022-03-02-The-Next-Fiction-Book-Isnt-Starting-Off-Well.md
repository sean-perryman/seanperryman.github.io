This is a three-book series. The first book was pretty good I will say, it actually held my attention. The second book, on the 
first page, is trying to shoehorn in some ze/zer/zim/whatever pronouns and it is annoying. The first book was written 
normal, like someone who was in touch with reality (even though I know that the author is not, he is a fucking nut job). I'm 
not sure if I am annoyed at that, or that this book conveniently skips the final part of the last book where the ship flips around 
(dangerous) and the colonists land and start building and stuff. 

I am going to try my best to get through it, I hope I do't adopt that stupid ze/zer vernacular in the process.
