I think that overall I am doing pretty well with my reading the bible in a year plan. Every day (7 days a week) there is a 
couple of chapters to read, and all in all it isn't too difficult to keep up with. Sometimes I miss the weekend, but I can 
usually get it made up on Monday. 

This time I missed from like Sunday to Thursday, and had a ton of reading to do. Not the worst thing in the world, but I would 
definitely not like to make a habit out of it. I would like to get into a routine of doing it every day just as a habit, but it 
doesn't seem like that is going to happen. I have too much other stuff going on I guess to maintain something like that. 

To be honest, usually I just forget, even though I have my bible within arms-reach basically at all times.
