In the middle of all this cold, snow, rain, and wind, we had a pretty lovely day! Ended up getting a bunch of work done using 
the metal we bought a few months back, enclosing stuff and trying to make it look more finished. Wife and MIL got a bunch of 
work done in the "seed house" (small greenhouse for sprouting seeds I guess), so basically all that is left on that is to build 
the back door and attach the greenhouse plastic.

All in all it was a good one!
