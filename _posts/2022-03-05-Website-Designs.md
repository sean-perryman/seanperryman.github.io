I had a nice meeting with someone a few days ago and one thing that came from it was talking about my website. I don't recall 
his exact words, but it was something to the effect that it was too plain and wouldn't really drive sales. This got me thinking 
so I opened up a bunch of tabs and pointed them at sites that I would view as competitors and they all basically had the same 
layout; a call or a piece of marketing material above the fold, with no pricing info prominently displayed. 

These people are all, for the most part, wildly successful; moreso that I could hope to ever be. Perhaps taking a cue from 
their design would be pertinent in launching my own business?
