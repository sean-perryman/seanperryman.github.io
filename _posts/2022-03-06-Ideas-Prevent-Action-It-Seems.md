title: Ideas Prevent Action It Seems

It seems like any time I start to make progress on some part of whatever I am working on I have an idea that basically 
overwhelms me and takes over any progress I am making. It's like this with construction stuff (e.g. constantly changing my 
mental design for the roof for my RV car port), to my "hosting" business (e.g. virtuozzo self-managed, to managed, to juju 
charmed openstack, to kolla, to solus io, back to VHI, to whatever), just seems to arrest any progress I have made. It doesn't 
help that I made some configuration errors, or rather cabling and management errors, last time I was in Dallas and I need to 
get those taken care of. I am hesitant to ask the DC to do it for me because for one I don't know that I have the available 
network ports where I need, and two it would require a bit of finagling to get what I want done working. 

I dunno, maybe I just need to take a step back and assess what I have and see what it would take to just get a minimum viable 
product out there.
