Remembering that anything that the US "media" tells you is the opposite of reality, I can't help but think there is something 
way more sinister going on. Obviously VP is not the most stable individual, but the fact that he is not sending his best to 
fight this "war" really makes you think. If he wanted to, with his military he could walk through Europe without much push back 
from them. He doesn't want to do that, he is working on something specific. 

Also, that the president of Ukraine was literally a comedian and routinely appears in an official capacity in a fucking t-shirt 
is unnerving to say the least.
