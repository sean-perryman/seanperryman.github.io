title: I Apparently Type Like An Imbecile

I finally plugged in my Kinesis Advantage2 keyboard and let me tell you: I can type like 2-3 WPM with it. 

Ridiculous. 

Turns out, I actually don't type at all like I am supposed to. Instead of keeping my hands on the home row, I basically use my 
middle and index fingers to do the majority of the typing, with my other fingers playing specific roles like hitting the space 
or the shift key or whatever. The new keyboard basically requires that you keep you hands on the home row, which after typing 
like this for like 30 years is really hard to do. 

Most people say you just have to power though it, which is what I will likely do, it's just hard and I tend to shy away from 
hard stuff. Like keeping this blog updated, or reading my bible every day instead of binging once or twice a week.

I've got to stop doing that.
