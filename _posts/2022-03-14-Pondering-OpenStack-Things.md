Sitting here thinking about things that would need to be functional when providing OpenStack virtual machines 
for folks, and DNS as a service came up in my head. Turns out that OpenStack has the Designate service, which 
does exactly that. It also integrates with Horizon so that is cool as well. Can't wait to get a new cluster up 
and going and try this out, still haven't decided where I am just going to sell VMs straight-up or offer people 
the "cloud" option. Could do the Cloud kind of like RamNode and just only have 1 flavor available or whatever. 
That actually isn't a bad idea, except for people taking advantage and spinning up as many machines as they can. 

Always another thing to consider, I guess.
