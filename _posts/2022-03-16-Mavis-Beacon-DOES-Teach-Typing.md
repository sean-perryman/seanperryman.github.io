Though the program hasn't been updated, at least visually, in quite a while, the program still kicks ass. Some 
reviews say that it crashes in Windows 10, but I have not had that experience. I spent about an hour this 
morning going through the lessons, and it felt really good. I felt like I could see improvement right then, 
moving from about 6 WPM to about 9 WPM consistently. Not where I want to be, but I'm only about a quarter of the 
way to it.

Thanks, Mavis, you never disappoint! 

Also, why does Mavis keep changing for literally every different version of the software? There are a bunch of 
different ones, that seem to only be different in the amount of content they have, yet every one of them has a 
different Mavis. Weird.
