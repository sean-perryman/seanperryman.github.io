I spent the morning practicing my typing, both in Mavis Beacon as well as on monkeytyper.com (which is 
fantastic, by the way). I've gotten from about 9 wpm up to about 13-14 wpm, so there is certainly progress, but 
it is not nearly as much as I'd hoped for. I'm hoping that if I continue to practice I will get up to a usable 
speed (I'm guessing probably 30-40 wpm would be usable for me) so I can go with my ergo keyboard straight up 
instead of switching back and forth.
