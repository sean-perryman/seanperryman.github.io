title: Apparently Arista Didnt Make The Same Number Of Rail Kits As Switches

Seriously, I'm not the only one to come to this conclusion. I did find the kits that were not exactly a match to 
what I have but they will work, ish. Only going to be mounting with the front set of ears, so will need to find 
something to support the backside a bit. The plus is that the Juniper switches I got are in the same boat, so 
they will probably be leaning on the Arista or vice-versa. Hope none of them ever fail!
