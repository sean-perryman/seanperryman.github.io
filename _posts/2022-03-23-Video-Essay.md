I think I just completed my first "video essay" and now need to record it. I was shooting for 5 minutes, about 
750 words, but ended up at about 1200 words. Oh well! 

Now I need to figure what to do for the video itself. I know that at least a good part of it will be me talking 
to the camera, but I want to mix in some other stuff like I've seen big creators do. There is a service called 
StoryBlocks for doing just that, I might check them out. Problem is their cheap tier ($15/mo) only lets you get 
5 clips a month, and just running through this video in my head I will need more than that. Might just sign up 
for the $30/mo tier and try and do a few videos to make it worth while. 

Yolo, right?
