I just watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SQ-TJKPPIg) documentary on Reddit by a channel called 
[Moon](https://www.youtube.com/c/Moon-Real). I knew that Aaron Schwartz was a part of it, but I never knew how 
much. He is missed. 

Also, these "power mods" are fucking crazy. They apparently deleted 6% of all posts on Reddit over the last 
year. That is fucking bananas.
