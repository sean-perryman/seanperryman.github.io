And let me tell you that game is fucking fantastic! It's good enough that I am questioning why I didn't really 
play turn-based games previously. Xcom comes to mind, especially because I own several entries in that series. 
There are a ton of other games as well that I feel like I have missed out on.

Now, if you will excuse me, I have to get back to killing aliens and infested humans!
