Lately I have been watching a lot of update video and trailers for upcoming Fallout mods. Fallout Miami is a 
standout, so is Fallout London. Both of these are like completely new games built on top of Fallout 4. Also, 
someone is remaking Fallout 3 in Fallout 4 which sounds like it is going to be fantastic.

A banner time to be a Fallout fan, for sure.
