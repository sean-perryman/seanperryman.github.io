I found a cool site that has thousands of CSS template ideas, and I want to download a copy (because these things have a 
tendency to disappear), but all of the normal website downloading tools are shitting out on me. It's really pissing me off.

Probably going to have to write a quick Python script to grab all the links to everything, then download it all 
systematically. It will take a long time I'm sure, but should work. It seems the site is on shared hosting so it's unlikely 
that it has any sort of protection from multiple requests.
