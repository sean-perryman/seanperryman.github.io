Website design is something I have always felt was a weak-point in my skills. Sure, I can put together something competent, 
but it is definitely not flashy or something I would necessarily want someone else to see. I've gone back and forth about 
hiring someone to make a site for me, but I just feel like it never works out. I've always said the reason I don't make 
websites for people is because everyone has this particular vision in their head, and no matter how hard you try you can 
never make them match up. 

Guess it's back to the drawing board for me.
