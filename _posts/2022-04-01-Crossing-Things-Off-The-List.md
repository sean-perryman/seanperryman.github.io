Is probably one of the most rewarding things you can do for yourself. Just the act of making a list itself is 
typically a plus, but when you start knocking those items off it is all the more better for you. 

I have lists upon lists upon lists. Sometimes I'll pick one up and just smash everything on it. Feels good! If I 
can just replicate this action hundreds of times, and consistently, I'll probably be less of a piece of shit.
