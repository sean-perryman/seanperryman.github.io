I did finally get Kolla-Ansible OpenStack with Ceph working, but the performance is less than stellar. I am 
under the impression now that basically fucking everything I bought for this project was wrong, and what I 
thought I new about hosting was also wrong. It seems I probably need some dual CPU nodes with more ram to do 
something like what I am wanting to do, with the single CPU nodes I currently have being more suitable for 
RAID10 local storage and like SolusVM or something. 

I don't really know what, if anything, I am going to do about it at this point, but it is frustrating to say the 
least.
