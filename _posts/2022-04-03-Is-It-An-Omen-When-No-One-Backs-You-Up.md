I tend to think so. In this "hosting venture" I am working on, no one I know is interested in participating. Not 
even like in passing with shit like the website or anything. Seems like maybe it is a bad idea, but I don't know 
if that is just me being defeatest or something. Maybe successful people have experienced this too and they just 
pushed through? Who knows.

What I do know is that this would be much easier with someone else helping.
