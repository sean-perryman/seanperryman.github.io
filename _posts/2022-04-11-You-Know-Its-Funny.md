How often I kick off a spree of posts with a post titled like "I'm behind!" or something like that. I guess that 
maybe that simple post gets the juices flowing or something, who knows.

Anyway, I am going to try and get through April today if I can. Since it is already June, I am far behind at 
this point, but it's just writing. It's not like I have to go and dig hundreds or thousands of feet of trench or 
something. I just have to buckle down and find something to write about; of which there is likely plenty if I 
consider everything that has happened.
