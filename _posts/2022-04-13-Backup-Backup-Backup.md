This can probably never be overstated, but you REALLY need to make sure and back your data up. Not just that, 
but please have multiple copies of backups and, ideally, multiple backup methods. Just because you have Veeam 
going and everything looks good doesn't mean that something is going to shit the bed and all the sudden you 
can't access those backups. Or worse, the backups don't work or you can't restore them. That's why I have a 
secondary backup for specific files that, if shit hit the fan, I could use to get the business rolling again. 

You can never be too careful, and keeping only one copy of a backup archive in this day and age, with storage 
pricing the way it is, seems irresponsible. Even for the clients who pay me very little I still have a few 
copies of their data ready to restore, just in case.
