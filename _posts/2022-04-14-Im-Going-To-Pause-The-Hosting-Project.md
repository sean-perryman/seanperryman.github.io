title: Im Going To Pause The Hosting Project

Basically, nothing for this project has gone the way I had hoped. I bought servers, but they are not ideal for a 
hyper-converged setup. I bought switches, but they were basically consumer grade. So I bought more switches, and 
that didn't improve anything at all, so why did I fucking bother? I used all SSDs, but the throughput on them is 
fucking abysmal such to the extent that I wouldn't even bother trying to sell this shit. 

I think it all boils down to the fact that I should be hosting somewhere more local to me so that I can make 
changes when necessary. Right now, I have to take an entire weekend to go to Texas and back, spending God knows 
how much money on fuel and shit just to make a few changes. Unfortunately, it would be more costly to try and 
pay the remote hands to do that shit, so I have to handle it myself.

There are a few datacenters really local to me, and a shit ton of them within a couple of hours drive, which is 
significantly more manageable. Probably going to go with that after I spend some time with the servers set up 
here at my house to work out these bugs and figure out what the fuck I am doing wrong.
