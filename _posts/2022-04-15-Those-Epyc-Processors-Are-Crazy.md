title: Those Epyc Processors Are Crazy

I usually would spec servers with dual Intel E5 (or equivalent) processors. Mostly to get the core count to 
where I want it. I have been looking at some of these Epyc processors, and I can get the same thing in a single 
CPU. Crazy to think how far they have come in such a seemingly short time. Oh well, guess I'm going AMD this 
time! 

I know with some of the KVM VPS', moving from Intel to AMD can cause panics, but no idea if that will/could 
affect Windows VMs. I guess we will find out soon enough!
