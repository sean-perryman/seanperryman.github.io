I'll be the first one to say it: I'm not SUPER great at keeping things updated. Sometimes I go up a version or 
two at a shot, and usually that is OK. This time, however, a Citrix upgrade rendered the 2FA useless. It now 
weirdly prompts for a password, but you can input anything in that field and it just lets you through.

Shit. Not what I wanted on a Friday.
