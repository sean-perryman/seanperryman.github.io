I know that I need to write more. I know that. Even if it is just trash like this, practice makes perfect. For 
over a year I have been paying $10 for LivingWriter; a web site that helps you write a book. I have a book 
partially written, but it is just sitting there now. I really need to get back into it, especially because I 
have most of the story fleshed out in my head, I just can't get started again. 

I tried the writing hour thing online where you jump on a zoom call with a bunch of people and just write. The 
problem is I spent more time looking at who was on the call, and it was just a fucking bunch of weirdos and 
people I assume are child molesters. That won't do at all.

In the end, I just have to do it. I just have to fucking do it. Just do it!
