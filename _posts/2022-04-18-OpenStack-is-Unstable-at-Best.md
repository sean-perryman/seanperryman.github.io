title: OpenStack is Unstable at Best

I like OpenStack. When it is working, it is absolutely fantastic. The problems begin when it is feeling under 
the weather. For example, OpenStack doesn't expressly provide services for booting from an ISO and performing an 
install manually. RamNode has a "hack" in place that allows for this. It works fairly well, but there are times 
where it just shits the bed and doesn't work at all. Now is one of those times. 

Same thing with doing simple tasks like powering on and instance after the whole system has gone down. This is 
not an unfathomable scenario, but one that has come up recently. My setup in Dallas, although it is idle, was 
working as intended. Now, it's throwing an error when I try and power on and instance. Just really frustrating 
as all.

Again, I love OpenStack. It's really fun to work with, but when you have problems you REALLY have problems.
