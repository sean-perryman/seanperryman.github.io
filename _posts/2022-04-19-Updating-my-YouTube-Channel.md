title: Updating my YouTube Channel

My last YouTube video upload was on this date. Today is June 16th, so I missed the entire month of May. Shit. I 
know that I can never hit the daily upload schedule that is the best for growth, but I really need to put forth 
more effort to upload at least once or twice a month. Ideally I would do once or twice a week, but baby steps I 
guess. 

It's not even that I don't have shit to say, I have a ton of video ideas that would not even be difficult. It's 
just like updating this blog, I just have to like be in the perfect mood to get it done. 

I'm trucking along with this now, who knows maybe I will finish the other like 30 updates I need to do and then 
I can move on to the other shit I want to do? Time will tell.
