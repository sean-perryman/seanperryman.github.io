title: Windows Storage Spaces is Interesting

I started pooping around the internet and came across Storage Spaces. This looks like a Windows version of Ceph, 
seemingly allowing you to allocate a bare disk to a pool that can be replicated across a cluster of Hyper-V 
servers. Seriously considering moving to Hyper-V from VMware, because Ceph doesn't play along with VMware and 
the VMware vSAN software is WAY too expensive. 

Wonder what the downsides might be for this?
