Man, these are often really interesting. There are a number of YouTubers that all they do is read these. Makes 
me wonder if I can do it too. Like I always tell myself, there is plenty of room for everyone on YouTube. 
Realistically, I watch multiple videos on a topic if I like the creators. The viewpoints and opinions don't even 
need to be different really, so long as I like the YouTuber.

Fuck man, that is probably the trick to YouTube success. I haven't really considered, but there are no YouTubers 
that I watch that I wouldn't like to hang out with in person. Except maybe TheQuartering, but only because he 
has a shitload of animals and I assume his house stinks.

Sorry, bro. Much love otherwise.
