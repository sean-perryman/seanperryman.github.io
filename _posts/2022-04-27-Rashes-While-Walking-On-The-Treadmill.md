Don't read this if you are easily offended. 

I get rashes between my legs when I walk on the treadmill sometimes. I never really thought too much about it, I 
got them as a kid as well. I'm walking right now and feeling nothing at all, but I'm wearing my "laundry day 
underwear." They are different than my normal underwear I like from Duluth Trading Company. These are some cheap 
ass fruit of the looms. The waistband folds over and they just never really sit right.

The other day I was wearing some duluth long boxer briefs and I got a really bad rash. I'm wondering if it is 
the underwear I'm wearing that is causing the issue? I'm going to try and wear another pair of these undies 
tomorrow and see if I'm still good. That would suck because I fucking hate these underwear. but I hate having a 
rash and pain when I'm walking more.
