I am not watching another Turkey Tom video about [Isabella Janke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBikkNuUk8), 
the person who seemingly leaked the whole Chris Chan fucked his mom audio. 

He isn't necessarily following the tropes of a good video I have had in mind, other than not having any static 
pictures. The closest is about a 4-5 second screenshot that is slowly zooming in. I always had in mind that I 
needed to have something happen about every 3 seconds in a video.
