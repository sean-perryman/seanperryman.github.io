A lot of people were upset with him going on a media tour after his trial and shit, but you have to remember he 
is just a kid. Quite likely someone is telling him what to do and he is just showing up.

Nick Rekieta thought that Kyle should have first appeared on his show, and he is absolutely right. That is where 
the majority of people were watching the trial, he was having 30k+ users for every stream, 8-9 hours a day. 
Crazy. 

Anyway, he is still just a kid. Cut him some slack.
