I am considering building a lower deck out front. Instead of a roof, I am thinking about one of those canvas 
stretched tarp things. Seems like a good idea, and they have basically the size that I want to make the porch 
ready to go. Looks like the price of lumber is pretty reasonable at the moment, around $1/ft for 2x4s. Strike 
while the iron is hot!
