Kind of wondering why I hadn't previously thought of doing a porch with a sail roof instead of a full wood or 
even corrugated roof. Should still provide sufficient protection from the sun, and even some from the rain, but 
would cost significantly less. The sail plus the hardware is like $60 instead of hundreds in boards, plywood, 
shingles, or corrugated roofing. 

Probably going to do it out front where I want to have the BBQ located. Would be nice to be able to get the 
whole thing done in a weekend!
