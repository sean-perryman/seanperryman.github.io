It does! Seriously, awesome. I am currently setting up and domain-joining a bunch of computers to an office 
across the country. Only small caveat was that I had to enable "force all traffic through VPN" on the Watchguard 
SSL VPN config. Other than that, works like a charm.

A bit slow, installing software and shit over the VPN, but it works. It seriously fucking works.
