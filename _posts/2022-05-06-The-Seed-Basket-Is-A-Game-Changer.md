I just was able to get my melon game up enough to win two silver medals, which I promptly exchanged for a seed 
basket. That thing is amazing! You can see a whole row of crops at once. I just need to figure out how to scam 
my way out of manually placing the water-covers and the slabs above the crops and I'll be in business!
