I used to watch A LOT of Oxhorn content like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d0XE4ak1F0). He does a good 
jjob of narrating Fallout content, from all the games. Recently, though, I've been watching TKs-Mantis and a few 
other people who are just killing it. Kind of sort of making me want to play Fallout again, though I am 
currently all the way up Hypixel SkyBlock's ass. Maybe I can squeeze it in sometimes!
