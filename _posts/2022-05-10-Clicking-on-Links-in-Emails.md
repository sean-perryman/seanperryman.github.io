No matter how many times you implore people to not do this, there are occasions where it happens. Luckily most 
people are quick enough that if something doesn't seem right, to just click off of it and that is the end of it. 
Unfortunately, sometimes people get in the zone and don't pay close enough attention, and inadvertently give 
their email address and password to a malicious site. 

Somedays you eat the bear, somedays the bear eats you.
