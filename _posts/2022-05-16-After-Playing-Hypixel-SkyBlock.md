Playing regular single-player Minecraft feels like I am walking in molasses. It's weird, I don't have that much 
increased speed on the regular, but apparently it is enough to make everything else feel like something is 
wrong. I was checking my FPS and my settings to see if there was something wrong with my computer.

It is awful.
