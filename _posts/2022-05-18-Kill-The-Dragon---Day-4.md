Day 4 saw a lot of the same, with fixing up houses and connecting the houses with each other. I build a set of 
stairs up the mountain to make it easier to move between. I built a boat a sailed across the point to get some 
sand to cook into glass. I also took the boat down the river to try and find a jungle, but no luck there. I need 
to get some cocoa to make brown die for my village house windows. 

Maybe tomorrow will be better!
