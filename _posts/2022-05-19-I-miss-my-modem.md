I don't know if I have talked about this hear or not, but like 4-5 years ago maybe I bought the domain immm.us, 
with the intention of creating a YouTube channel called "I Miss My Modem." It would feature "reviews" of sorts 
of BBS games and the like.

Recently, I've started thinking about doing this again. I don't think I would limit it to just BBS games, 
though, maybe expand out to things that I would have gotten at the time. Doom, Castle of the Winds, shit like 
that. 

It's still rattling around in my head, who knows if I will do it or not.
