Seriously. I buy books all the time with the intention of reading them, but I basically never do. Then I'll get 
on a tear and read 3-4 books straight through, then nothing for months. 

At some point I will say fuck it and become a real reader, but until that day I have a pile of hopes and dreams 
on my desk staring at me every day.
