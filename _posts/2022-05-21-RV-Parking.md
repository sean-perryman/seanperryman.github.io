I have an RV and a bunch of grass area. This means that when it is not being used, the grass grows up under it 
and is annoying. You cannot mow it without moving it.

I mowed an area down and laid out some weed barrier, then placed rocks over the top to create a semi-decent 
parking spot for it. 

In hind sight, doing something like this right on the ground you not only need to level the ground, but you also 
need to have a decently smooth surface. There are spots under the rocks that are still fluffy with the grass, 
and it is slightly annoying. I assume at somepoint in the future this will subside. Will probably need to add 
more rocks over time to try and level it.

Oh well, live and learn.
