I forgot to mention that on Day 2 I also spent some time restoring the house I am living it. Removing cobwebs, 
replacing the missing logs and cobble, that sort of thing. At some point I am going to have to smelt some sand 
and dye it so I can reproduce the brown glass.

Day three was much of the same. I followed the path from the first new house I found and found a bunch more, 4 
or 5. I spent some time down there restoring them and getting them all nice and pretty again. When I finish with 
a house I like to put a door up so I know that one is down and ready for someone. 

Night was upon me at this point so I slept in one of the newly renovated houses. It does get chilly with no 
windows, but I will manage.
