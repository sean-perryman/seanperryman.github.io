Day 2 was actually pretty uneventful. I spent most of the day just cleaning up the village some, trying to get 
the trees out of the path and working on making it easy to get between buildings. 

I am hopefully going to fence this all in at some point in the future. If I am lucky I can get some zombie 
villagers to come by and I can cure them so I can make this a real village.

Time will tell!
