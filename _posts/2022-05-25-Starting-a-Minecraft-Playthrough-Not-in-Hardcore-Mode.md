I had the idea today to try and actually beat the dragon in Java without being in hardcore mode, since I've only 
ever "gone all the way" in Bedrock. So, I'm doing it here and will hopefully be able to journal at least some of 
my playthrough. It is probably going to be in backward order since I am still catching up on old blog posts, but 
whatever. If I can actually do it that will be feat enough.
