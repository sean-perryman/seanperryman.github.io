These guys get people who otherwise couldn't afford it into homes. In my case, my credit was slightly lower than 
good but they worked it out. These homes are built REALLY poorly. I know they are just trying to make a profit, 
but fuck man. This whole fucking thing is crafted from 2x2's it seems. 

The wall behind the shower had a weird wet spot at the bottom. I took the wall off, and the fucking pex line 
that connected to the showerhead was barely on. Now that whole wall in there is soaked, as is the insulation 
underneath. What a fucking shit show. Fuck these guys.
