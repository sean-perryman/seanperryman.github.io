My friend is kicking around the idea of setting up a co-working space in California. The idea is interesting but 
certainly not new; you set up a place with a bunch of tables and chairs and wifi, and people pay a fee (like a 
gym) to come and work there. To be honest, if there was something like that here where I am I would probably do 
it. It would be nice to get a change of scenery every now and then.

The concept seems to be pretty solid, there are several of them in surrounding communities but none where he is 
looking specifically. And where he is, is in the middle of a bunch of tourist traps; this place is where the 
locals live. So I feel like it has a good chance of succeeding here. 

I really hope it does.
