title: I Think I Messed Up Trying To Learn A New Keyboard

I never had this problem before I started trying to learn to use the Kinesis Advantage2 keyboard, but now I feel 
like when I am typing on a regular keyboard my fingers get confused. It's hard to explain, but I've always been 
a prety fast typer; even though I do not type correctly. I mostly use my index and middle finger, and just move 
around the keyboard as needed. I know it would be better to do the home-row and type like someone who knows what 
they are doing, but it is VERY difficult to change after 30+ years of typing this way.

Lately, my fingers basically feel like they are confused. It's hard to explain, but I'll be typing and then all 
the sudden I'll start to notice my fingers. I don't usually, they just do what they are supposed to do. It is 
definitely a weird situation.

I probably just need to bully ahead with the new keyboard and typing the correct way to try and save my joints 
from the eventual pain I will cause them.
