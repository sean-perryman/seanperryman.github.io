For whatever reason, I still have my YouTube channel. My associated Twitter has basically devolved into me 
talking shit to people, so I renamed it to keep those separate. The YT channel is still on topic, though.

I had all these grand plans of keeping up with it and such, but that all kind of fell by the wayside I guess. 
Not too late, as the videos still get some views. I just need to get motivated to make some content. 

I am hoping that after I get this site caught up that maybe I will feel good about life again and want to do 
something there. Still a metric shit ton of stuff I could and perhaps should talk about, so we'll see!
