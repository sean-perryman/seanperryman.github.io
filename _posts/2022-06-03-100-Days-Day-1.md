I came across a really cool Minecraft 1.18.2 seed that has a big island surrounded by a ravine about 800 blocks 
away from spawn, so I thought that it might make for a good 100 Days try. I also watched a video where someone 
who is way better at this than me said that one of the key elements of these things is to document what you have 
done as often as you can, so you can see where you have been. So, that is what I am going to try and do here.

Day 1: I spent the first part of day 1 walking to the coords of the island I want to build my house at. When I 
got there, I chopped down a few trees, built a wood pick, and grabbed stone to make myself some tools. I think 
created a bunch of oak slabs and bridged across to the island. I spent the rest of the day and night working on 
clearing out the trees on top of the island so I have a nice place to build a house. 

There are differnt biomes on every side, and just looking around I think I see enough sheep to make a bed, so 
that is probably what I am going to do next. I cooked up a stack of oak logs to get charcoal so I can make 
torches, which I then used to light up as much of the island as possible to prevent mob spawning.

No idea yet if I will be able to go all the way with this, but I am certainly going to try!
