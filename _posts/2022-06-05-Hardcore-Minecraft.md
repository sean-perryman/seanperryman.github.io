I know I've talked about this 100 times at least, but I really like Hardcore Minecraft, even though it is too 
hard for me. I mean that in a general sense, since I have never been able to complete the game in Hardcore mode. 
In fact, I've only ever "beaten" Minecraft on Bedrock. Shit, maybe that is the thing? Maybe I need to beat the 
game on Java before I start getting my shit all in a bunch about hardcore more? 

Funny, now I want to play MC, and I am trying to catch up on my writing. Distractions are a motherfucker.
