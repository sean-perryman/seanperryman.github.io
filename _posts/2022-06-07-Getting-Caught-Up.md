I know at this point it must just be my nature, but I always seem to get caught up in one thing or another and 
end up forgetting to do the shit I'm supposed to. Like work and such. 

I've been playing a lot of Hypixel SkyBlock lately, and that seems to have wholly monopolized my time similar to 
how World of Warcraft did when I first started playing. Not quite as bad as I don't stay up late to play it or 
anything, but it's open on my computer all day and I check in on it periodically. 

Probably need to stop playing, but eh fuck it. I could do worse I guess.
