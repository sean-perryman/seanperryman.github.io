I spoke earlier about my hunch that my underwear that I have worn for years (the brand, duh) was actually 
causing me to get a rash when I walk. I had a slight one this morning, so I switched into the laundry day 
undies, and it's all good!

In my favorite undies defense, I think it is only specific pairs that cause problems. Namely, the super long 
boxer briefs. They are seriously almost down to my knees, they are that long. The normal boxer briefs don't seem 
to cause the issue.

Weird how shit like that happens.
