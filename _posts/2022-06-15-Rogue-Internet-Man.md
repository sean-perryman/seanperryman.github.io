Don't get me wrong, I've "broken up" with Rogue and come back several times. He has always kind of a been a 
fringe kind of guy, but his shit was entertaining. Apparently, he kicked someone out of a discord server so they 
are trying to dox him and send his info to the ATF. This is way worse than just swatting, they are trying to get 
this man killed. Not fucking cool.
