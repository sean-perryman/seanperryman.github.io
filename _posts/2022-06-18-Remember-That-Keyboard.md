I literally think every single morning about just swapping out for my Kinesis keyboard that is sitting off to my 
right. For whatever reason I just don't do it. This is made more weird by the fact that I have literally seen 
progress in using it. I was really painfully slow with it, and after a few days I became almost passable. It 
would stand to reason that a few more days and I'd be in the pocket, but I just can't bring myself to do it. 

I really have the ultimate goal of getting to the point where I can utilize a [Dactyl 
Manuform](https://ohkeycaps.com/products/built-to-order-dactyl-manuform-keyboard) keyboard as my daily driver. 
Maybe a part of this is so I can ditch the right-side and game with just the left, but that is not strictly a 
requirement I guess. More of a desire or something that I just want to try out. 

I should just buy one of those keyboards and have it right in my face so I can't ignore it.

Not that it worked with the Kinesis, but shit, third time is a charm maybe!
