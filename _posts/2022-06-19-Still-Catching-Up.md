But, surprisingly, making really good progress! I hammered out a bunch of days last week to get me nearly caught 
up, now I just need to hit the final stretch. I shudder to think about the other shit I am a month plus behind 
on, but if I can get this caught up I know I can do that too. Just have to hunker down and do it!
