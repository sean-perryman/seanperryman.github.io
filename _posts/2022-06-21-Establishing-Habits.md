Seems to be the most insurmountable task ever. Something so fucking simple is just so difficult to execute. When 
I sit and think about it, I currently have a habit of waking up and collecting the shit from my Minecraft 
minions. Why is that a habit, but doing something I actually want to do (like reading or writing) isn't?

I read something once that the screen is literally addicting, and that if you read first for the day instead of 
looking at a screen you'll be able to easier, but even with that knowledge I still can't or won't follow it. 

Perhaps one day I will get my head out of my ass.
