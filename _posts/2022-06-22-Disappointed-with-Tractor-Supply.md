Usually when you order something online and it says its in stock, and you get an email stating you can pick it 
up, that is the end of it. Here, I actually ordered something, called and verified they had it, then I received 
the pick confirmation. Turns out, the manager of this store is unable to read and marked the completely wrong 
thing as what I ordered. 

Reading is hard as fuck I guess.
