Seriously. After I got the Seed Basket, I got excited to build another pumpkin deck for my farm. So I started on 
that, not realizing at the time that even going fast it still takes 3-4 hours to complete. I'm not even done, 
yet I feel compelled to finish.

I think it is just that way with SkyBlock. You can certainly play casually, but to get even the most medium of 
gear and stuff you have to play a lot. You can't just pop in and do a couple of things and expect to advance at 
all. 

In that way, it's a lot like World of Warcraft, except here I don't think you can pay someone to level up your 
shit.
