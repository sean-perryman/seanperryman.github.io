Well, I spent a few days without hooking my regular keyboard back up, and I can say I am certainly improving in 
my usage. Not quite where I want to be yet, but it's getting better. I don't feel panicked when I get a ticket 
where I have to type out a response. I will say, though, that typing passwords is problematic at best. 

I ended up switching back yesterday just for that reason, and it's interesting that I wasn't immediately 
proficient at the layout. It took me a few minutes of fumbling before I had it down again. 

Maybe something in your brain changes when you use a different layout? Who knows.
