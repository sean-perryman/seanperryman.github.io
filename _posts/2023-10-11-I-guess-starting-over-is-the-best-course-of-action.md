So I spent probably 7 hours altogether working on this, with the express intent of getting a theme working, and 
I have failed. I know when I have been beat, so I killed the repo and started over. 

Maybe it had something do with the Jekyll version being old, who knows. Just copying in my posts seemed to work 
so I guess it's whatever. 

Not sure if I will keep writing here or not, though I would really like to get a theme in place. And maybe the 
ability to comment. Who knows.
