I've been messing with this thing all day long, off and on while grading papers, and it just won't work the way 
I think it should. It started off that I just wanted to deploy a simple theme. I checked the docs, made sure it 
was "GitHub Pages Compatible", and nothing. The homepage doesn't work when that theme is deployed. 

So I rolled things back, and now all the style is gone. 

This is frustrating to say the least.
