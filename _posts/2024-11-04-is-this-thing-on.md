Well, it's been quite a journey this year. I've been working on keeping up with my on-paper journalling and I'm doing pretty good I think. 

Still have some prior missed days to catch up on, but I think at the very least I can get this whole 2024 journal done by the end of the year. 

I have probably two months of journals to do for 2023, but I have a lot of topics jotted down so hopefully I can get that done.
