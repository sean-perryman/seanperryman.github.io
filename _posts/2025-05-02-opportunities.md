I think everyone, at some point, sees opportunities where they might be able to eek ahead in life. Whether it is work, or family, or whatever. I've tried to take a couple of those opportunities recently, and they have fell through.

Should that stop me from trying new ones that come along? Not at all! Just because something doesn't work out doesn't mean the next thing won't. 

I tried for like 8 months to update this thing every day. I failed at it because I got a couple of days behind and never tried to catch back up, which I definitely could have done. I am a huge BS'er, and can often just sit down and write something like this without thinking. Several somethings. 

I failed at keeping my daily physical journal updated as well. Even now I'm several days behind, but realistically that is just a matter of sitting down for 30 minutes and getting through it. I still have many open spots in 2024 and 2023, and maybe someday I will get to those. 

Never keep trying to find more in life, whatever that looks like for you.
