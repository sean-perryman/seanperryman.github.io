I started messing around with OpenStack again locally, and it is about like I remember it; non functional. Even MicroStack, which at least used to be able to deploy a machine you could use locally, doesn't work. The installer quits, and the Canonical team knows about it. The ticket submitted several months ago is in status "Triaged", which means they don't give a shit. 

I will say that DevStack deployed without issue, but I can't get any external access to VMs. Even with a second NIC. Even with setting up the config the way they suggest to get that all working. Doesn't work.

What I need to do is pull my portable cloud rig out so I can at least use MAAS to redeploy the server OS when I need to try again. Using the USB drive for the install doesn't take long, but it's a pain in the ass. I couldn't get unattended access to work. 

Lame!
